You can run this project also without docker, but I recommend that you run the whole project with docker compose because all the services are integrated.


To run this project with npm:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Configure the backend: Ensure that the backend server is set up and running correctly.
4. Setup .env file for environment variable `VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/` it is the API default url. 
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open the application in your browser: `http://localhost:8080`
